# Teaching Material: Detecting Objects with Pretrained YOLOv5

## Introduction
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most popular object detection models. With YOLOv5, we can detect objects in images and videos with impressive speed and accuracy. 

Using a **pretrained YOLOv5 model** saves time and resources because it has already been trained on the **COCO dataset**, which contains 80 common object classes like people, cars, cats, dogs, and more.

## Benefits of Using a Pretrained YOLOv5 Model

1. **Fast Setup**:
   - No need to train a model from scratch.
   - Get started with object detection in minutes!

2. **Accurate Detection**:
   - Pretrained on the COCO dataset, YOLOv5 recognizes 80 object classes.

3. **Customizable**:
   - You can filter detections to specific classes like cats, dogs, or people.
   - Detect everything or focus only on the objects you care about.

4. **Versatile**:
   - Works with images and videos.
   - Can be easily integrated into fun, practical, or educational projects.
